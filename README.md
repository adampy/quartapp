# Trackr API
The Trackr API is a Quart application built in Python, which creates an asyncio API used for the my AQA A Level Computer Science NEA. Quart is a micro web framework built on Asyncio. It is very similar to Flask but allows me to use asyncpg to access the database asynchronously.

The API is hosted on Heroku alongside the PostgreSQL database - allowing for very little latency between systems.
